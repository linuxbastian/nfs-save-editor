# NFS Save Editor

Welcome to the NFS Save Editor, a universal savegame editor for EA BlackBox-era Need for Speed games. This project is primarily written in Java, but I might switch to C++ if necessary. However, I enjoy coding in Java! =)

- Need for Speed: Underground :x:
- Need for Speed: Underground 2 :x:

Let's see how far I will get with this Project! =)
